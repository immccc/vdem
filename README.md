# VDem: Democracy helper

## Background

Groups of humans can form groups where decisions can be taken that affects the rest, no matter how big or small the group is and the weight one person has on it.

Given that interactions, decision taking and management tends to be polluted because a lot of factors like undercovered interests, pressure groups, fuzzy bureaucracy, overall corruption, etc. would be ideal to let a formal protocol 
as an arbiter.

But most important and honest reason is, I want to get my hands dirty on Golang. I've so far read and analysed Go code, but not created anything.

### Features

#### Population
- Ability to identify univoquely one person that can only have just one register. There won't be any way to have a particular with multiple registrations.

#### Funds
- A BTC wallet will contain funds that can be used to offer services for people that are up to date with payment requirements.
- A Ledger that can be queried to check contributions.

#### Rules
- A set of immutable rules that have to be pushed to the system by consensus quorum.
- Population may be punished by restricting ways of interacting if rules are not followed.
